After saying they plan to acquire “profitable SaaS companies,” they soon follow with “No support staff answering tickets.” That’s a pretty big red flag; if I’m the paying customer, I’ll be working hard to find a replacement if this company acquires one of my vendors.<p>This business plan reads like Soulless Private Equity who comes in, eliminates staff expenditures and increases subscription pricing by an order of magnitude to pump the valuation, then sells to some unwitting buyer at a huge profit with a total disregard for the consequences to customers, employees, and whomever else might provide resistance to their monetary motives.<p>“If you think we&#x27;re wrong, don&#x27;t apply.” I’m pretty sure that should go without saying for any job on offer. Phrasing like this just confirms to me there’s no nuance.<p>Are these the current ethics in Y Combinator?",

The invoice is now marked &quot;Locked&quot; in their billing portal.<p>I cannot pay this invoice. There is no button to pay it. There is no button to dismiss it. There is no way to interact with it at all.<p>Azure displays a banner: &quot;You must pay all previous invoices before creating new subscriptions.&quot; Fair enough. I would love to pay it. Microsoft won&#x27;t let me.<p>So I tried to contact support.<p>The Azure portal requires a &quot;paid support plan&quot; to create a support ticket. To purchase a paid support plan, you must create a subscription. To create a subscription, you must clear outstanding invoices. To clear outstanding invoices, you must contact support.<p>Azure on Twitter, as well as the website claims to have a &quot;free support ticket&quot; option for billing issues, but every possible link just drives you back to the same FAQ page while refusing to let you submit a ticket.<p>I called every number I could find:<p>1-800-867-1389 rings busy indefinitely. 1-855-270-0615 connects to an AI that asks what you need, tells you to visit the website, and disconnects. 1-800-642-7676 connects to a different AI that also tells you to visit the website. The website has a chatbot that redirects you to FAQ articles regardless of what you type. If you express frustration, it throws an error and stops responding.<p>I submitted feedback through the Azure portal every few days for weeks. No response.<p>I am a software engineer, so I did something ridiculous.<p>I wrote a PowerShell WinForms application that authenticates via device code flow, queries the Az.Support API for problem classifications, and calls New-AzSupportTicketsNoSubscription to submit a billing support ticket directly, bypassing the portal entirely.<p>Note the API name: NoSubscription. Microsoft has an explicit API for ticketing without a subscription.<p>It worked. The ticket was submitted. I felt briefly victorious.<p>The API responded: &quot;Your support plan type is Free. To create and update support tickets, you need access to our high-tier support plans.&quot;<p>I had built custom software specifically to work around Microsoft&#x27;s broken support infrastructure, and I still hit a paywall.<p>The total amount Microsoft is owed: $24.<p>The total amount Microsoft is preventing me from spending on new Azure services: thousands. I currently run numerous websites out of my house, and it&#x27;s getting to be enough that I want to offload it to Azure VMs. Additionally, I was going to shift my development to Azure boxes, etc.<p>I have exhausted every official channel. Every phone number, every chatbot, every feedback form, every API endpoint. There is no path to a human being without first paying for a support plan that I cannot purchase because of the billing block that I need support to resolve.<p>Has anyone successfully escaped a loop like this? Is there a secret handshake I&#x27;m missing? Or is the only option to abandon this Microsoft account entirely, get a new phone, and start fresh?",

It&#x27;s trying to be both a minimal and distraction-free experience while being feature-rich and allowing for tons of use cases.<p>What Kraa&#x27;s good for:<p>- Distraction-free writing &amp; reading (minimal UI, performant, styling logic completely separated from the editing experience)<p>- Quick sharing of any written text – compared to many other writing tools, your content can be easily shared just by posting a link and giving &#x27;read&#x27; or &#x27;edit&#x27; access (we also have password-protection)<p>- Real-time chat &#x2F; communities – Kraa has some unique features around real-time editing and our Chat widget allows for a frictionless chat experience. No send button.<p>- Kraa works well on mobile (though dedicated apps are planned)<p>---<p>Demo examples (all live, no login needed):<p>Blog article: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kraa.io&#x2F;kraa&#x2F;examples&#x2F;echolibrary\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kraa.io&#x2F;kraa&#x2F;examples&#x2F;echolibrary</a><p>Long-form story: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kraa.io&#x2F;kraa&#x2F;examples&#x2F;insidekick\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kraa.io&#x2F;kraa&#x2F;examples&#x2F;insidekick</a><p>Magazine: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kraa.io&#x2F;weeklyinspiration\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kraa.io&#x2F;weeklyinspiration</a><p>Kraa is built on top of ProseMirror (and TipTap) and Svelte.<p>You don’t need an account to try Kraa.
